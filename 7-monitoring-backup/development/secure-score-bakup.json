          "description": "<p>Authentication strength is a Conditional Access control that allows administrators to specify which combination of authentication methods can be used to access a resource. For example, they can make only phishing-resistant authentication methods available to access a sensitive resource.&nbsp; But to access a non-sensitive resource, they can allow less secure multifactor authentication (MFA) combinations, such as password + SMS.</p> <p>Microsoft has 3 built-in authentication strengths. MFA strength, Passwordless MFA strength, and Phishing-resistant MFA strength. Ensure administrator roles are using a CA policy with <strong>Phishing-resistant MFA strength</strong>.<br />Administrators can then enroll using one of 3 methods:</p> <ul> <li>FIDO2 Security Key</li> <li>Windows Hello for Business</li> <li>Certificate-based authentication (Multi-Factor)</li> </ul> <p><br /><strong>NOTE</strong>: Additional steps to configure methods such as FIDO2 keys are not covered here but can be found in related MS articles in the references section. The Conditional Access policy only ensures 1 of the 3 methods is used.</p> <p><strong>WARNING</strong>: <strong>Administrators must be pre-registered for a strong authentication mechanism before this Conditional Access Policy is enforced</strong>. Additionally, as stated elsewhere in the CIS Benchmark a break-glass administrator account should be excluded from this policy to ensure unfettered access in the case of an emergency.</p> <p><strong>Rationale</strong>:</p> <p>Sophisticated attacks targeting MFA are more prevalent as the use of it becomes more widespread. These 3 methods are considered phishing-resistant as they remove passwords from the login workflow. It also ensures that public/private key exchange can only happen between the devices and a registered provider which prevents login to fake or phishing websites.</p> <p><strong>References</strong>:</p> <ol> <li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-passwordless#fido2-security-keys\" target=\"_blank\">FIDO2 security keys</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/howto-authentication-passwordless-security-key\" target=\"_blank\">Enable passwordless security key sign-in</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths\" target=\"_blank\">Conditional Access authentication strength</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy\" target=\"_blank\">How To: Configure the Microsoft Entra ID multifactor authentication registration policy</a></li> </ol>",
